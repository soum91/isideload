# Claude development instructions

Read and follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before changing source, release workflows, or publishing releases. Every GitHub Release must have factual, specific, evidence-linked notes and a matching CHANGELOG.md entry. Do not replace actual changes with generic text or claim unverified fixes.


## Diagnostic/reporting rule for Claude

Before implementing or changing any diagnostics or logs, follow the **Universal diagnostic copy and export contract** in `AGENTS.md`: verified Copy with visible feedback, native Share, native plain-text Files export, and complete selectable report. Avoid claiming these work until a signed-device paste and export check is complete.


## Universal diagnostic export contract

Every diagnostic/log report requires Copy with clipboard read-back verification where supported and visible success/failure, native Share, native Save as `.txt` with Files picker (`fileExporter` or `UIDocumentPickerViewController` on iOS), and selectable full text fallback. No silent clipboard-only buttons. Include app/version, device/OS, actionable return codes and redact secrets. Test cross-app paste, Share, Save on a signed device; otherwise mark unverified. Preserve existing policies.
